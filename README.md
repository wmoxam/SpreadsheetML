SpreadsheetML Library
---------------------

This is a very basic parser for the scourage that is SpreadsheetML.

The basic idea is to get the data out, and fuck the formatting.

If someone else wants to diddle around with a file format that was supplanted by an even shittier one ("Open" Open XML File Format) then knock yourself out.
